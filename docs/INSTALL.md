# Installation

## From source

There are currently no pre-compiled finalfrontier binaries. Compilation
requires a working [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) toolchain. After
installing Rust, you can compile finalfrontier using cargo:

~~~shell
$ cargo install finalfrontier
~~~

Afterwards, the `finalfrontier` binary is available in your
`~/.cargo/bin`.
